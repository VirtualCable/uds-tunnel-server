# UDS server location. https NEEDS valid certificate if https

# Since OpenUDS v4.0, the UDS tunnel token must be obtained using the script
# "reg_tunnel.py" located under:
#     /openuds/server/sample/
# in the OpenUDS server repository.
#
# Example usage:
#   python3 reg_tunnel.py \
#       --username root \
#       --password udsmam0 \
#       --broker-host {openuds_server_host:port} \
#       --tunnel-ip {tunnel_server_host:port}
#
# This command will register the tunnel with the UDS server and return
# a unique "uds_token" value. Use that token in the configuration below.
